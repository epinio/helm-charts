# Default values for epinio-application.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# This is the API between the epinio server's deployment code, and
# charts implementing the deployment, like this one.

# appName            :: string                 :: application name
# replicaCount       :: integer                :: number of instances (pods) to deploy
# stageID            :: string                 :: id of stage run generating the app image
# imageURL           :: string                 :: reference to app image in registry
# username           :: string                 :: user triggering deployment
# routes             :: sequence (route)       :: routes (= domain+path+id) the app has to be reachable at
# env                :: sequence (assignment)  :: app environment variables and values
# configurations     :: sequence (string)      :: names of the configurations to import into the app
# configpaths        :: sequence (config)      :: names and mount paths of the bound configurations
# start              :: integer                :: time of deployment, nanoseconds
# ingress            :: string                 :: ingress class name to use, if any
# tlsIssuer          :: string                 :: name of cert issuer
##
#  assignment :: map ('name' -> string, 'value' -> string)
#  route      :: map ('id' -> string, 'domain' -> string, 'path' -> string)
#  config     :: map ('name' -> string, 'path' -> string)
#
# The field 'configpaths' is a replacement and extension of field 'configurations', separating a
# configuration's name from from its mounting path in the application container. This allows for
# using a more human-readable path. The server fills both fields so that old(er) charts can still
# work, even if they are unable to take advantage of the nicer paths of the extension.

# The `start` element can be used to force a restart of specific resources with each
# re-deployment. This standard chart uses it in a pod template annotation, forcing pod
# restart.
#
# This is required because an app may have to ingest changes to resources outside of
# itself.  I.e. an update to a bound configuration
